              I listen to many different kinds of music. Not death metal
              thought. I kinda hate it, for personal reasons. I also like
              writing, to be quite honest.
            </p>
            <p class="intro-paragraph">
              But the idea of writing a blog post is really not my thing right
              now. I mean I can write pretty okay - especially with a little
              practice, I used to be in a writing club while at school - but
              just not now. Now I need to write code.
            </p>

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
              But I need to write something to make this text long and I just
              don't want to lorem ipsum it. Bingo! I'm gonna write music lyrics
              then. And this song just happened to be playing at the time I'm
              making this. It's a nice song anyway. So why not?
